--------------
Formula-based RAGAS scoring for the live chat interface.

Scores exactly one real user query + the RAG-generated answer + the chunks
retrieved for it. Every metric is computed from OpenAI embedding cosine
similarity — no judge LLM call — since the LLM-as-judge version needed
5-6 sequential model round trips per evaluation and was too slow for
interactive use.

    Faithfulness        — fraction of answer sentences whose embedding is
                           close (>= GROUNDING_THRESHOLD cosine similarity)
                           to at least one retrieved chunk.
    Answer Relevancy    — cosine similarity between the question embedding
                           and the answer embedding.
    Context Precision   — rank-weighted average precision (same formula
                           RAGAS's own non-LLM metric uses) over the
                           retrieved chunks, treating cosine similarity to
                           the question >= GROUNDING_THRESHOLD as "relevant".
    Context Recall       — same grounding computation as Faithfulness. No
                           ground truth exists for a live turn, so the
                           generated answer stands in as the reference —
                           same reference-free spirit as the other metrics.

Requires OPENAI_API_KEY in .env (used only to embed text, no LLM calls).

Calibration note: with text-embedding-3-small, a faithfully *paraphrased*
sentence typically scores only ~0.45-0.65 cosine similarity against its
source chunk — nowhere near 0.75+, which is reserved for near-verbatim
restatements. GROUNDING_THRESHOLD is set below that paraphrase band so
real RAG answers don't read as unfaithful just for being reworded.

This also means these metrics measure topical/semantic grounding, not
factual entailment: a fabricated detail on the same topic as the
retrieved chunk (e.g. a wrong dollar figure) can still land above the
threshold, since cosine similarity can't verify specific facts the way
an NLI/LLM judge can. Use these scores as a fast grounding signal, not
a hallucination detector for precise figures.
